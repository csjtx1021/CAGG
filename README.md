This code is implemented according to the paper "Cost-Aware Graph Generation: A Deep Bayesian Optimization Approach". Cost-Aware Graph Generation (CAGG) can generate optimal graphs at as low cost 
as possible.  We apply it to two challenging real-world problems, i.e., molecular discovery and neural architecture
search, to rigorously evaluate its effectiveness and applicability.

## Folder description:

    CAGG-Molecular-Discovery: Molecular Discovery, including two molecular properties, i.e., 5*QED-SA and logP-SA
    CAGG-NAS: Neural Architecture Search (NAS), including cell-based NAS and multi-branch NAS

Please go to their respective folders for details.

This code has been tested on the environment with MacOS and Python3.
