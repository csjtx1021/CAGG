This code is implemented according to paper "Cost-Aware Network Design with Deep Bayesian Optimization 
and Goal-Oriented Generation". Cost-Aware Network Design (CAND) can design optimal networks at as low cost 
as possible.  We apply it to two challenging real-world problems, i.e., molecular discovery and neural architecture
search, to rigorously evaluate its effectiveness and applicability.
