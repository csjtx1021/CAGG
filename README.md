This code is implemented according to paper "Cost-Aware Network Design with Deep Bayesian Optimization 
and Goal-Oriented Generation". Cost-Aware Network Design (CAND) can design optimal networks at as low cost 
as possible.  We apply it to two challenging real-world problems, i.e., molecular discovery and neural architecture
search, to rigorously evaluate its effectiveness and applicability.

Folder description:

    CAND-Molecular-Discovery: Molecular Discovery, including two molecular properties, i.e., 5*QED-SA and logP-SA
    CAND-NAS: Neural Architecture Search (NAS), including cell-based NAS and  multi-branch NAS

Please go to their respective folders for details.

This code has been tested on the environment with MacOS and Python3.
